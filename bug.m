In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error involves the misuse of `self` within methods, particularly in conjunction with properties and memory management.  Consider this example:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (strong, nonatomic) NSString *myString;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)setMyString:(NSString *)newString {
    self.myString = newString; // Potential issue here
}
@end
```

While seemingly correct, this code can lead to a retain cycle. When `setMyString:` is called, `self.myString` implicitly calls the setter again, leading to a circular reference where `self` retains `myString`, and `myString` (indirectly via the property's strong reference) retains `self`. This cycle prevents either object from being deallocated.

Another less obvious case involves using `self` in blocks:

```objectivec
- (void)someMethod {
    dispatch_async(dispatch_get_global_queue(DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY_DEFAULT, 0), ^{ 
        [self doSomething]; // Potential issue 
    });
}
```

If `self` is deallocated before the block executes, `doSomething` will result in a crash because `self` is no longer valid.  This is a common cause of crashes that can be difficult to track down.
